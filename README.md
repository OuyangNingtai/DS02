## FreqRepFusion: A Frequency Domain Approach for Recommendation Systems

This repository contains the implementation of FreqRepFusion (FRF), a novel frequency domain approach for sequential recommendation systems that analyzes user behavior patterns in the frequency domain to better capture repetitive interests.

### RecBole Framework

Built on the RecBole framework for recommendation system research.

## Features

- **Frequency Domain Analysis**: Decomposes user interests into high-frequency (repetitive) and low-frequency (exploratory) components
- **DTW Repetition Tracking**: Uses Dynamic Time Warping to track repetitive interest patterns
- **Unified Fusion Mechanism**: Adaptively combines repetitive and exploratory interests
- **Comprehensive Ablation Study**: Evaluates the effectiveness of each component
